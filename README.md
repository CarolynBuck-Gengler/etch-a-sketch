# Etch a Sketch

The Odin Project, Web Development 101 Project: Etch-A-Sketch

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) 

This project is part of the section on DOM manipulation using javascript.

Some of the things I learned or improved my understanding of in the process of working on this project:

* using Codepen to resolve issues in discrete components of the problem

* using css grid

* using both 'box-sizing: content-box' and 'box-sizing: border-box' to achieve the result I was looking for

* improved ability to grab a particular element and manipulate it in javascript

* improved use of event listeners and classes

* figuring out different ways to change the pen color, including methods not suggested by The Odin Project (found one in the Javascript30 set of projects)
